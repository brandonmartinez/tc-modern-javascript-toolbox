# The Modern JavaScript Toolbox: 20 Years in the Making!
Git repository for my That Conference 2018 Precon: https://www.thatconference.com/Sessions/Session/12898

## Abstract

The toolbox of the JavaScript developer has changed drastically over 20 years. Gone are the days of writing in `<script>` blocks of your HTML waiting to be parsed by Netscape Navigator!

Today we have a seemingly-infinite supply of tools, packages, frameworks, and snippets to build anything ranging from a slightly-enhanced web page to a full-blown responsive or mobile application. In this web of technology, it's important to remember that with great power, comes great responsibility.

### Workshop Goals

Our goal is to start from an empty folder to building a small JavaScript single-page application. We will be touching on many technologies in the JavaScript ecosystem, in addition to discussing some alternatives to the ones we use.

Some of the technologies that will be used and/or discussed:

* The Node.js JavaScript Runtime
* JavaScript package managers such as NPM, Yarn, and Bower
* Task runners such as Gulp.js or Grunt
* Transpilers like Babel
* Front-end frameworks such as React, AngularJS, Angular, and Vue.js

### Requirements

To participate in the session, you will need to following:

* A Laptop or Other Machine Capable of Running Windows, macOS, or *nix
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or other text editor/IDE
* The latest version of [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
* A [Github](https://www.github.com/) or other source repository account
* Fingers at the ready for the JavaScript to flow!

## Agenda

### Part 1: Introduction and a History Lesson

Let's talk about how far we've come in the [20+ years](https://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html) of having our (sometimes least) favorite language available to us!

### Part 2: Setting Up a Node Application

We'll focus on project setup and structure, giving our code a place to live and breathe. We'll also setup and tooling needed to build our application, as well as talk about the pros-and-cons to some of the common alternatives.

* Create a new git repository for the project
* Setup a project folder structure for a Node-based application
* Setup NPM tools and utilities required for session (gulp, webpack, etc)
* Kick off a project.json file and get rolling into part three!

### Part 2: Building the Application

Now that our project has a place to exist, it's time to start building it! We'll utilize some of the latest-and-greatest tools available in the JavaScript world, as well as work through some practical tips on how to plan for scaling to medium-and-larger-sized applications.

* Create a React and Redux application
* Setup webpack and Gulp.js to help build our assets
* Setup a dev server and some live-reload action to stay refreshed while we develop
* Get our ES6+ on with our good friend, Babel
* Make something other than a ToDo app or contact list!

### Part 3: Deploying the Application

We have a working app… or hopefully we do; we did spend only a couple hours building this thing. Regardless, let's deploy this to the WWW, or as you modern kids might call it, the cloud!

* Build production-ready assets destined for a greater server than our laptops
* Take those assets and deploy to Azure (or other host)

### Part 4: Open Discussion

I like to close out every session with Q&A and discussion. This is your opportunity to take what we learned together and apply it to your real world scenarios and ask questions!
